#export MACHINE_CONFIG_OPERATOR_LOCAL_IMAGE=https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator
# NOTE: If a checkout already exists in $HOME, it won't be re-created.
# NOTE: You must set CUSTOM_REPO_FILE to build some OpenShift images, e.g. ironic ones.

# Use <IMAGE_NAME>_EXTRA_PACKAGES to set the path (relative to dev-scripts or
# absolute) to a file with extra packages to install in the image, one per line.
# At the moment, this option is supported with ironic-image and ironic-inspector-image
# For example:
# export IRONIC_EXTRA_PACKAGES=ironic-extra-pkgs.txt

# Uncomment this to build a custom base image for ironic images
# export CUSTOM_BASE_IMAGE=true

# Set this variable to point the custom base image to a different location
# It can be an absolute path or a local path under the dev-scripts dir
# export BASE_IMAGE_DIR=base-image

# To build custom images based on custom base images with custom repositories
# put all the custom repositories in a .repo file inside the base-image directory
# (default to dev-scripts/base-image) and set this variable with the name of the
# .repo file, e.g. if the filename is ocp46.repo
# export CUSTOM_REPO_FILE=ocp46.repo

# export BASE_IMAGE_FROM=centos:8

# If needed, we can fetch the change associated to a Pull Request for the images
# we're building locally. Specifying the PR number will fetch the PR, switch the
# local image repo to it, and build the image locally with that specific change.
# For example, for the PR #34 for the ironic-image:
# export IRONIC_PR=34
