    # locally administered bit is set low. (The libvirt default is
    # to set the 2nd MSB high.) This effectively allows our
    # fake baremetal VMs to more accurately behave like real hardware
    # and fixes issues with bridge/DHCP configurations which rely
    # on the fact that bridges assume the MAC address of the lowest
    # attached NIC.
    # MACs generated for a given machine will also be in sequential
    # order, which matches how most BM machines are laid out as well.
